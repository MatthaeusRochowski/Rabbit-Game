# Rabbit-Game

Piedro the rabbit goes home. Unfortunetly his house is in Ingolstadt Nord and he is in Ingolstadt Süd. He has to cross the A9. 

It´s rush hour and lots of cars and trucks are driving from Nürnberg to Munich and opposite direction.

Piedro starts his highway cross walk with 3 lifes. If Piedro crashes with a car or truck he looses one life and will be resetted to Ingolstadt Süd. With every succeeded cross walk his score is incremented and he enters the next level where more cars and trucks are driving on A9 and become faster with each level.

Sometimes Piedro finds carrots on his way. When he eats them he gets extra score. After 3 carrots he gets one extra live. 

Bonus:

Piedro and his girlfried Francesca make a race, who will arrive home first.
